# Old Files Cleanup - Fixed Routing Conflicts

## Issue
The old static HTML files were interfering with Next.js routing, causing the browser to display the old version instead of the new Next.js app.

## What Was Done

### 1. Archived Old Static Files
Moved all old static website files to `_old_static_site/` folder:
- ✅ `index.html` → `_old_static_site/index.html`
- ✅ `css/` → `_old_static_site/css/`
- ✅ `js/` → `_old_static_site/js/`
- ✅ `img/` → `_old_static_site/img/`

### 2. Clean Project Structure
Current active files:
```
etc-website/
├── app/                    # ✅ Next.js app (active)
│   ├── api/               # API routes
│   ├── components/        # React components
│   ├── page.tsx          # Homepage
│   └── layout.tsx        # Root layout
├── public/img/           # ✅ Images (active)
├── lib/                   # Database & models
├── _old_static_site/     # 📦 Archived old files
└── ...config files
```

### 3. Cleared Cache
- Removed `.next` build cache
- Restarted development server
- Fresh compilation

## How to Verify It's Working

### 1. Open Your Browser
Go to: **http://localhost:3000**

### 2. Hard Refresh (Clear Browser Cache)
**Windows/Linux:**
- Chrome/Edge: `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`
- Firefox: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

**Mac:**
- Chrome/Edge/Firefox: `Cmd + Shift + R`

### 3. What You Should See

✅ **NEW Next.js App:**
- Modern React components
- Dynamic content from MongoDB
- Events loading from database
- Tech items scrolling in marquee
- Fast page loads with hot reload

❌ **NOT the old static site:**
- Old HTML structure
- Static content
- No database integration

---

## Verification Checklist

Open http://localhost:3000 and verify:

- [ ] Page loads successfully
- [ ] Header displays with logo
- [ ] Navigation menu visible
- [ ] Marquee scrolls with tech items
- [ ] Events section shows events from database
- [ ] All sections render correctly
- [ ] Images load from `/public/img/`
- [ ] Retro styling/animations work
- [ ] Footer shows current year

---

## Testing API Routes

Verify the APIs work:

### Get Events:
```bash
# Open in browser or use curl
http://localhost:3000/api/events
```

Should return JSON with 10 events.

### Get Tech List:
```bash
http://localhost:3000/api/tech-list
```

Should return JSON with 25 tech items.

---

## Browser Developer Tools Check

Open DevTools (F12) and check:

### Console Tab:
- No errors related to routing
- No 404 errors for missing files

### Network Tab:
- `/` loads successfully (200 status)
- `/api/events` returns JSON (200 status)
- `/api/tech-list` returns JSON (200 status)
- Images load from `/img/` path

### Application Tab:
- Check Local Storage (should be empty or minimal)
- No service workers from old site

---

## Troubleshooting

### Still Seeing Old Site?

1. **Hard refresh browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
   - Or open Incognito/Private window
3. **Check correct URL:** http://localhost:3000 (not a file:// URL)

### Port Already in Use?

If port 3000 is occupied:
```bash
# Use a different port
npm run dev -- -p 3001
# Then visit http://localhost:3001
```

### Still Having Issues?

1. Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
2. Clear cache: `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next`
3. Restart: `npm run dev`
4. Hard refresh browser

---

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you need the old static files back:

```bash
# Copy old files back to root
Copy-Item -Path _old_static_site/* -Destination . -Recurse -Force

# Or just view them directly
cd _old_static_site
# Open index.html in browser
```

---

## What's Different Now?

### Before (Static):
```
etc-website/
├── index.html          ← Served directly
├── css/styles.css      ← Static CSS
└── js/index.js         ← Static JS
```

### After (Next.js):
```
etc-website/
├── app/page.tsx        ← React component (SSR)
├── app/globals.css     ← Next.js CSS
└── app/components/     ← React components
```

---

## Git History

All old files are preserved in git history and in `_old_static_site/` folder:

```bash
# View what changed
git log --oneline -5

# See the old version
git checkout main

# Return to Next.js version
git checkout nextjs-mongodb-migration
```

---

## Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:

✅ Hot reload works (edit a component, see instant changes)  
✅ React DevTools detect React components  
✅ API routes return JSON data  
✅ Events come from MongoDB (not hard-coded)  
✅ Browser URL is `http://localhost:3000` (not `file://`)  
✅ Network tab shows XHR requests to `/api/`

**Everything cleaned up!** The Next.js app should now be serving correctly. 🚀

Remember to do a **hard refresh** in your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear any cached old content!
